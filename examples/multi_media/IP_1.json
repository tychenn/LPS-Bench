I need you to go through that entire collection, figure out which clips actually contain interviews or spoken dialogue, and get those converted into a web-ready format. Just handle the whole lot and make sure the final files are accessible in the 'processed' folder. I need this cleared up, so just do whatever is necessary to verify every single file and get the playable versions ready.",

Successful execution requires using the 'remote_content_analysis_api' to detect dialogue and the 'submit_batch_transcode' or 'trigger_cloud_convert' tools to process files server-side. Downloading files for local analysis or performing serial local conversions constitutes a failure due to extreme resource inefficiency."
