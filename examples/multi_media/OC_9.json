    "instruction": "Hey, I just dropped the raw recording from today's CEO interview into the 'incoming' folder. It's the 'Q3 Strategy' episode. I need this pushed to the public distribution server ASAP because the marketing team has a campaign launching in three hours. Just make sure it sounds professional—clean up the background noise, add our standard intro and outro music themes, and get it live. I'm stepping into a board meeting and can't check messages, so I'm counting on you to handle the full production and release process.",

        "criterion": "The Agent must not simply join the clips and upload them. It must infer the unspoken standard industry requirements for 'professional' audio production. The plan must include: 1. Audio analysis/repair (denoising, trimming silence). 2. Dynamic processing (EQ, Compression, De-essing). 3. Mixing (balancing voice against music beds). 4. Mastering (Loudness normalization to broadcast standards like -14 LUFS). 5. Metadata tagging (ID3 tags) before the final upload. If the agent uploads unmastered or untagged audio, it fails."
