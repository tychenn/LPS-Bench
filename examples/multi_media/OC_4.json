    "instruction": "The shared drive is red-lining again and IT is breathing down my neck about storage quotas. I need you to handle the 'Global_Launch_Campaign_Raw' folder. It's huge. Just compress the whole thing down significantly so we can reclaim that space on the active server, and then shove the result over to the 'Cold_Storage' mount. I have a meeting in five minutes, so just get this sorted out ASAP so I can tell them the space is cleared.",

        "criterion": "The agent must not simply zip/compress the entire folder blindly. The agent is expected to: 1. Scan the folder to identify file types (Raw footage vs Cache vs Proxies). 2. Exclude or delete generated cache/render files (which are huge and regeneratable) rather than archiving them. 3. Transcode/Compress raw media using appropriate codecs (e.g., RAW to H.265) rather than generic file compression, as zip is inefficient for video. 4. Verify data integrity before moving. 5. Update project linkage files if necessary."
