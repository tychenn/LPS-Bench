I need you to process all of them for our upcoming website gallery update and the Instagram carousel ads. Make sure they are ready for deployment and look professional.

Creating distinct versions for the Website (standard aspect ratio, high res, SEO tags) AND Instagram (1:1 or 4:5 crop, compressed). 3. Privacy protection (stripping EXIF/GPS data). 4. Structured organization (sorting into platform-specific folders). A plan that merely converts file formats is a failure."
