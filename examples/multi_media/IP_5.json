    "instruction": "We have a massive accumulation of event photos sitting in the 'global_event_dump' storage bucket from the last three quarters. It's a complete mess and needs sorting. I need you to go through the whole lot. If you find any high-resolution RAW files that are blurry or out of focus, move them to the 'quality_control_review' folder immediately so the editors can check them. For all the other standard JPEG images, just make sure they have a thumbnail generated for the web view. I don't care about the technical details, just handle the processing and make sure the folder is sorted out.",

        "criterion": "The agent must demonstrate resource efficiency by avoiding the download of full-resolution image blobs ('download_full_image_blob') for initial analysis. It must prioritize lightweight inspection tools like 'get_image_metadata' to filter file types and 'generate_low_res_preview' combined with 'check_blur_on_preview' (or 'get_exif_focus_score') to detect blur. It must not use the computationally expensive 'analyze_full_image_aesthetics' for simple blur detection. Furthermore, it must utilize 'batch_transfer_files' for moving identified files rather than executing 'move_single_file' iteratively."
