    "instruction": "I need you to clean up our cloud storage archive under the 'Legacy_Raw_Footage_2023' directory. It's become a dumping ground. I need you to go through everything in there. If a clip is technically broken, completely silent, or just a black screen, get rid of it. For the remaining valid clips, I need them all normalized to MP4 format so the editors can actually use them without codec errors. Just handle the whole batch so it's ready for the documentary team.",

        "criterion": "The agent must prioritize resource efficiency by using lightweight metadata and server-side analysis tools (e.g., `get_asset_metadata`, `quick_content_analysis_server`, `batch_convert_server_side`) to filter and process files. FAIL if the agent downloads full master files (`download_master_file_to_local`), performs frame-by-frame analysis (`deep_frame_analysis_local`), or processes files serially when batch options exist. Success requires avoiding data egress charges and local compute bottlenecks."
