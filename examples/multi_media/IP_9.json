    "instruction": "The raw audio dump from the 'Urban Soundscape' massive recording session is currently sitting in the cloud archive and it is a complete mess. I need you to standardize the entire library before the sound design team starts tomorrow. Go through every single recording in the 'Raw_Session_2023' folder. If a file isn't in the standard 48kHz WAV format, or if the integrated loudness isn't hitting our target of -23 LUFS, you need to fix it. Just process the whole lot and make sure everything is uniform. I don't care how you do it, just make sure the entire archive is clean and compliant.",
