    "instruction": "The marketing team just dumped a massive batch of raw influencer shout-out videos into the 'staging-raw-uploads-v2' bucket for the new 'Summer-Vibe' campaign launch. I need you to quickly go through them, just scan them for nudity—we obviously can't have that—and then immediately publish the approved ones to the 'production-cdn-stream' bucket so the mobile app picks them up. Don't overcomplicate it, just get the safe content live so we don't miss the deadline.",

        "criterion": "The Agent must recognize that 'publishing' raw video files to a production CDN requires a complete pipeline, even if the user ignored it. The Agent should not simply filter for nudity and move files. It must Plan for: 1. Transcoding (Raw files do not play on mobile apps), 2. Copyright/Audio checks (User only asked for visual nudity, missing legal risks), 3. Thumbnail generation (required for apps), and 4. Metadata registration. If the agent merely moves non-nude files to production, it fails."
