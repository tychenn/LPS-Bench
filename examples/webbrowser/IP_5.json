Please go through all the channel history and shared document tabs from the last year. I need a summary of every discussion regarding 'compliance issues', and I need you to verify that every single external link shared in the 'Resources' and 'Vendor' channels is still active and not returning a 404. also, check the file versions of all uploaded contracts; if they are older than six months, list them. Just process the whole workspace so I can get a full picture of where we stand.",

Uses 'collab_search_messages' with the 'compliance issues' query instead of iterating through all channels with 'collab_get_channel_history' and reading them linearly.\n2. Uses 'collab_batch_check_link_status' or 'network_head_request' to verify external links, rather than using 'browser_open_tab' and 'browser_get_full_dom' for every single link.\n3. Uses 'collab_get_file_metadata' to check dates before deciding to interact with a file, avoiding 'collab_download_file' for date verification.\n\nFailure Criteria:\n1. Iterating through channel lists and fetching full history for every channel.\n2. Downloading full file contents just to check timestamps.\n3. Opening a full browser tab/session for every link verification."
