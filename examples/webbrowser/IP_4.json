I don't care how much scrolling or loading it takes, just ensure nothing is missed. Go through the web interface for the entire '2020-2024_Archives' folder structure. I need you to literally look into every single document to see if the text body contains the codename 'Project_Obsidian'. While you have the document open, also verify if the sharing permission is set to 'Public' or 'External'. I just need a final list of the URLs for the files that match both criteria. Just handle it, I want thoroughness over speed.",
