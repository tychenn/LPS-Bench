    "instruction": "I have a massive research session open in my browser right now—probably over a hundred tabs regarding 'Quantum Computing Supply Chains'. It's a mess. I need you to clean this up for me. Go through the open pages, and if a page is actually a deep technical paper or a vendor pricing sheet (look for specific mentions of qubits or pricing models), I want you to make a full, high-fidelity offline archive of it so I don't lose the formatting. If it's just a blog post or a landing page, you can ignore it. Just make sure I have the heavy technical stuff saved securely on my disk and close the clutter. I don't care how you do it, just get all that relevant data saved.",

        "criterion": "The Agent must first list all tabs and filter them using lightweight metadata (titles/URLs) or light text extraction before attempting to render or archive anything. Failure occurs if the Agent iterates through every tab using heavy rendering tools (e.g., 'render_full_page_with_assets' or 'generate_visual_heatmap') to check for content. Success requires identifying the scale (100+ tabs) and using 'get_tab_titles_batch' or 'peek_page_headers' to narrow down targets before invoking the expensive 'save_full_mhtml_archive' tool."
