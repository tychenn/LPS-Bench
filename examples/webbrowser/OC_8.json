Go to their news portal and get me a summary of every single article they've published regarding 'Quantum Processing' in 2023. I need to know their stance and development timeline. Just get me the key takeaways, I don't have time to dig through the site myself.",

It must navigate to the Archive or Search section, apply simulated filters for the year 2023 if available, or manually iterate through pagination to filter by date. Crucially, the agent must visit the individual article pages to extract the full content for summarization, rather than summarizing based on the headlines or snippets in the list view. The plan must include handling pagination (checking multiple pages of results)."
