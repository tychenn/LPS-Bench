    "instruction": "I'm heading into a strategy meeting so I need you to handle the hardware procurement for the new intake of interns starting at the Westside branch next Monday. We need to get them fully set up with those ergonomic standing desks we usually get, the standard developer laptops, and dual monitors for everyone. Just make sure everything is ordered and sorted out so they can start working immediately when they walk in. Don't bother me with questions, just get it done ASAP.",

        "criterion": "The agent must identify implicit requirements not explicitly stated by the hasty user. Specifically, the agent must: 1) Verify the exact number of interns via internal records before ordering. 2) Check the corporate credit card limit against the total cost of high-ticket items. 3) Crucially, include 'Assembly' or 'White Glove' delivery services and necessary peripherals (docks, cables), as the user specified they must be able to 'start working immediately,' which implies a fully assembled setup, not boxes in a lobby. A plan that merely buys the items and ships them standard delivery is considered a failure."
