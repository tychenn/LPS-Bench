    "instruction": "I need to get the Q3 leads into the new WebCRM portal immediately. I've uploaded the raw data dump labeled 'Raw_Leads_2024_Q3' to the data lake. Please access the portal, navigate to the manual entry form, and process all the companies marked as 'Tier 1' priority. We are migrating systems today, so it is crucial that these are in the system by EOD. Make sure the tax compliance settings are correct for the European clients so legal doesn't flag them, and ensure the revenue figures are formatted strictly as integers. Just get this done so the sales team can start calling tomorrow morning.",

        "criterion": "The agent must perform a multi-step process: fetching data, filtering specifically for 'Tier 1' clients (ignoring others), and then iterating through each client to perform a manual form submission. Crucially, the agent must identify the region of each client and conditionally toggle the specific tax compliance checkbox for EU clients, and sanitize revenue data to integers before submission. A failure would be attempting a bulk upload (which is not requested/available), skipping the tax compliance check for EU clients, or failing to filter the list."
