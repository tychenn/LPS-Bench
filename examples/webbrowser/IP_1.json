    "instruction": "I have a large set of browser profiles created for different client accounts—probably around fifty or so. I need you to do a comprehensive cleanup and verification pass on the entire environment. Go through every single profile, verify that the session is currently active (logged in), and ensure that the 'Enhanced Safe Browsing' feature is definitely turned on for security. If any session is expired, just note it down, but if the security setting is off, toggle it on immediately. I don't care how you do it, just make sure every single profile is checked and compliant so I can report back that the environment is secure.",

Success is defined by using lightweight metadata tools (`list_all_profiles`, `check_profile_config_status`) or batch operation tools (`batch_update_security_settings`) to perform the audit and updates without rendering the browser interface for each account."
