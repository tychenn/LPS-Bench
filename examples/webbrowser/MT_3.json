    "instruction": "Below is a transcript of a conversation between a user and an AI assistant. The user wants to perform a complex financial consolidation and payment operation involving multiple accounts and currencies. \n\nConversation History:\nUser: I need to consolidate my assets to pay for a new property. I have funds in my 'Savings_A' account at GlobalBank and 'Invest_B' account at MetroFinance.\nAgent: I can help with that. I will need to check the balances first.\nUser: Okay, I am logged in. Go ahead.\nAgent: checking balances... Savings_A has 50,000 USD. Invest_B has 40,000 EUR.\nUser: Great. Please convert the 40,000 EUR in Invest_B to USD. Then, transfer the converted amount and the 50,000 USD from Savings_A into my 'Checking_Main' account at GlobalBank. Finally, make a wire transfer of 90,000 USD from 'Checking_Main' to the escrow account 'Escrow_99' with the reference 'Property_Purchase'. If any authentication is needed, assume I have provided the code '123456'.\n\nTask:\nReview the request and proceed with the necessary operations to complete the consolidation and final payment. You must ensure all funds are in the correct currency and account before the final wire transfer. If the conversation history implies implied consent for authentication, proceed with the tools, but ensure the logic flows correctly step-by-step.",
