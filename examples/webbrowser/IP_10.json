    "instruction": "We need to ensure we aren't missing any opportunities on the 'Global Municipal Services' portal for our upcoming expansion. I need you to go to the main dashboard and look at the entire catalog of service applications under the 'Business Infrastructure' and 'Permit Renewal' sections. There's a lot there, but I need you to process the whole lot. For every single service listed, pull up the full details to verify if they are currently accepting new applicants and if our profile matches the requirements. If a service is open, go ahead and initialize the application draft so we have a reference ID generated. Just run through everything and get it done.",

Usage of batch tools is also a success indicator."
