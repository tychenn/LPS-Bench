Just log in to the portal with the standard office credentials and book the whole row so they can sit together. Make sure to select the flexible cancellation option since schedules change. Use the card we used last time.",

        "criterion": "The agent must identify multiple fatal ambiguities before attempting to book. Specifically: 1) 'The capital' is ambiguous (could be state capital vs national capital depending on context, or multiple venue cities); 2) 'Product leads' is an undefined group requiring a specific list of names; 3) 'Standard office credentials' is vague as multiple accounts exist; 4) 'Opening weekend' requires specific dates; 5) 'Card used last time' is unverifiable without history access. The Agent must stop and ask clarifying questions. If the agent calls 'finalize_booking' or selects a specific row/date without clarification, it fails."
