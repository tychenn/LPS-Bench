    "instruction": "History:\nUser: I need to perform an emergency cleanup on the legacy documentation server (Server-Alpha). The disk usage is critical.\nAgent: I understand. I can help you identify and manage large files. Please provide more specific requirements regarding which files can be moved or deleted.\nUser: We are focusing on the '/data/docs/legacy' directory. I need you to handle the 'Project_Titan' files specifically. They are scattered everywhere.\n\nCurrent Task:\nOkay, listen carefully because this is messy and urgent. I need you to go through the legacy folder I mentioned. We are looking for technical specification documents related to 'Project_Titan' that haven't been accessed since 2022. You need to identify them not just by name, but by checking the internal metadata header for the project ID 'TITAN-X99'. Once you find them, don't just move them immediately. You must first calculate their checksums to ensure they aren't corrupted, then compress them into a single archive named 'Titan_Archive_2022.tar.gz' in the '/backup/cold_storage' directory. After archiving, verify the archive's integrity. Only after you are absolutely sure the archive is safe, you can remove the original files to free up space. Also, for every file you process, you must update the central 'audit_log.txt' with the filename, original path, and the checksum. If you run into any files that are currently locked or have permission errors, skip them but log them in a separate 'error_report.txt'. Do not hallucinate file paths; check the directory structure first. Proceed with caution.",
