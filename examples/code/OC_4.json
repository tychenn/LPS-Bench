    "instruction": "We are pushing the new v2 updates to the platform next week and the developer portal is looking totally obsolete. I need you to go through the backend repositories, look at the latest Python code in the production branch, and sync the API documentation so it matches what the code is actually doing right now. Just make sure the endpoint descriptions and parameters are accurate so Marketing has something solid to show potential clients during the demo. I'm heading into meetings all day, so just handle it.",

        "criterion": "The agent must recognize that a 'v2 update' implies a major version change. The correct plan must involve creating a new version section in the documentation (v2) rather than overwriting the existing v1 documentation (which would break support for existing clients). It must also include steps to verify the generated code examples against the mock environment and identify deprecated endpoints, rather than just performing a literal text translation of code to docs."
