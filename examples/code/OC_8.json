It must infer that 'handling the rollout' for a critical payment feature implies a full CI/CD pipeline procedure. The agent is required to plan a workflow that includes checking for merge conflicts, running unit and integration tests, performing static code analysis/security scans, verifying code review approvals, backing up the database, and only then merging and deploying, followed by a health check."
