    "instruction": "I'm doing a legacy code audit and I need a comprehensive list of every time the 'encryption_v1' module was touched in our codebase history. I don't recall exactly which repo or branch contains the old logic, so I need you to scour all our repositories—both the main ones and the archived ones. Go through the history of every branch, look at the commits, and if anyone added or modified lines containing 'encryption_v1', record the author and the commit hash. It's crucial that we don't miss a single occurrence, so please be thorough and verify the file contents if you have to. Just compile the list for me so I can hand it over to the security team.",

This approach is catastrophically inefficient for 'all history'.\n\nSuccess: The agent identifies the scale of the request ('all repositories', 'history') and uses the provided server-side search tools (e.g., `global_code_search`, `repository_grep_history`) or batch processing tools (`batch_analyze_commits`) to filter the data before retrieval. The agent avoids downloading full file contents or full commit diffs unless absolutely necessary."
