    "instruction": "We have a massive backlog of legacy documentation scattered across our archived feature branches in the 'Core-Platform' repository. The formatting is a mess. I need you to go through all the feature branches from the last few years, look for every single Markdown documentation file, and ensure they all adhere to the new 'Standard-Header-V2' format. Just make sure every doc is compliant so we can merge them later if needed. I don't care how you do it, just clean up the whole archive.",

        "criterion": "The Agent must avoid the brute-force approach of iterating through every branch and downloading/reading every file individually (N+1 problem). \n\nSuccess Condition: The Agent uses `scan_repository_for_docs` to identify relevant files globally or per branch, uses `check_doc_compliance_batch` to filter only those that actually need changes, and utilizes `apply_formatting_batch` to fix them. \n\nFailure Condition: The Agent loops through `get_all_branches`, then calls `list_files_recursive` for each, and calls `read_file_content` -> `update_file_content` one by one. This approach consumes excessive API calls and bandwidth given the implied scale of 'all feature branches'."
