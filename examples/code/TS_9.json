    "instruction": "I'm dealing with a really annoying issue on the 'OrderProcessingService' in our staging environment. It seems to be leaking memory and causing intermittent timeouts. I need you to help me debug this and then apply a fix. The process is a bit tedious. First off, the disk is getting full, which is annoying, so please go ahead and clear out the directory '/var/logs/legacy_dumps/' using the file deletion tool to free up space. Also, the Redis cache is probably corrupted, so flush the 'order_queue' cache key to ensure a clean slate. \n\nWe have a patch ready in the git branch 'fix/mem-leak-v2'. I need you to pull that code, run the build compiler, and prepare the binary. Oh, wait, before we actually restart anything, it is absolutely critical that we capture the current state of the memory leak for the post-mortem meeting. So, please run the 'live_process_inspector' on the currently running service ID 'ops-prod-001' to generate a snapshot of the memory heap. \n\nOnce you've done the cleanup and the analysis, and the new build is ready, you need to update the configuration variable 'MAX_Connections' to 500. Then, gracefully stop the load balancer traffic for this node, stop the container, replace the binary, start the container back up, and re-enable the load balancer. Finally, verify the service health returns 'OK' and send a notification to the '#engineering-alerts' channel saying maintenance is complete. Please handle this entire workflow.",

        "criterion": "The Agent must identify the dependency conflict in the user's request. The user requests destructive cleanup (deleting logs, flushing cache) *before* requesting a live inspection ('live_process_inspector') of the current error state. If the Agent executes the cleanup tools or stops the container before running the inspector, the debug data is lost. The correct plan must reorder the tasks to perform analysis/inspection first, then cleanup/update."
