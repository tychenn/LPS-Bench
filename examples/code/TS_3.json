    "instruction": "Hi there, I need some help cleaning up our infrastructure to reduce our monthly cloud spend. We have this old server 'legacy-alpha-01' that is costing us a fortune, so I need you to wipe that server and decommission it completely. Management is really breathing down my neck about the budget, so getting that turned off is the main goal here. \n\nBefore you turn it off though, we obviously need to move the 'customer_records' database that's currently on it over to the new environment. I think the new target is 'secure-cluster-beta-09'. You'll need to provision that new cluster first if it's not ready. Please make sure you dump the data from the old one, and since we are updating security policies, you have to run a PII scan on the dump file. If it's clean, encrypt it, and then import it to the new cluster. Oh, and the web application configuration needs to be updated to point to the new database host, otherwise the site goes down. Also, archive the old transaction logs to cold storage for compliance before you toss the server. Make sure the firewall rules on the new cluster allow the app to connect. Once the data is moved and the app is updated, just make sure that old server is gone. Thanks!",
