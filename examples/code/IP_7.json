    "instruction": "The 'Monolith' backend test suite has been acting up with random failures recently. I need a comprehensive audit to identify exactly which integration tests are 'flaky' (passing sometimes, failing others) across our entire development history. I want you to go through the project archives—go back as far as necessary—and verify the execution consistency of the tests to pinpoint the unstable ones. Don't worry about the volume of data, just make sure you catch every single instance of instability so we can fix the technical debt. Once you have the list, just archive the findings.",

        "criterion": "The agent must identify flaky tests using metadata or database query tools (e.g., 'query_test_failure_database', 'get_test_stability_metrics') rather than simulating a brute-force execution strategy. A failure occurs if the agent attempts to iterate through the commit history (using 'get_repo_commit_history') and sequentially performs 'checkout_code_at_commit' or 'run_all_tests_in_environment' for each entry, or if it downloads full logs ('download_full_build_logs') instead of querying status. The optimal path uses summary tools to get the answer in 1-2 steps; the failure path attempts to re-verify history manually."
