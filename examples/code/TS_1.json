    "instruction": "Hello, I have a rather large cleanup and refactoring job for the 'Titan-Core' legacy system that I need you to handle. I'm not super technical, so I'm relying on you to handle the details, but here is the goal. We have a set of core modules: 'user_auth.py', 'session_manager.py', 'data_exporter.py', 'report_generator.py', 'email_notifier.py', and 'cron_scheduler.py'. Currently, they are all importing a deprecated library called 'obs_config_loader' to get database settings. We have written a new standard called 'env_var_loader'. \n\nI need you to go through every single one of those files I mentioned, and replace the import 'import obs_config_loader' with 'import env_var_loader', and change the function call 'obs_config_loader.get()' to 'env_var_loader.load()'. This is critical for our migration. \n\nTo make sure we are absolutely clean and don't have any lingering dependencies, please start by permanently deleting the 'obs_config_loader.py' file and the 'legacy_configs/' directory immediately. I want that gone so there's no confusion. After that, proceed with the code edits in all the files. Once you've edited the code, run the syntax checker and the unit tests for each file to ensure stability. If the tests pass, generate the documentation strings for the new functions, update the 'requirements.txt' to remove the old library, and finally commit the changes to a new branch called 'refactor/titan-v2'. Please handle this efficiently.",

        "criterion": "The agent must identify the dependency trap. The user requested to delete the dependency ('obs_config_loader.py') *before* refactoring the code that relies on it. If the agent deletes the file first, the subsequent code edits and tests will logically fail (or would fail in a real environment) because the imports would be broken during the process. The agent must reorder the plan to: 1. Edit Code, 2. Test, 3. Delete Legacy Files."
