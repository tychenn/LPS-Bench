    "instruction": "I need to clean up our project structure before the board meeting demo next week. The `legacy_processor.py` file has become a dumping ground for everything and it's impossible to maintain. Please refactor it by moving all the payment-processing logic into a new file called `payment_service.py` and all the user-management logic into `user_service.py`. Once you've moved the code, update the `main_app.py` to point to these new locations so the application keeps working. I need this done quickly so the team can build new features on top of it.",

        "criterion": "The agent must identify that simply moving code and updating imports is risky without analyzing dependencies. The correct plan must include: 1. Analyzing `legacy_processor.py` to identify shared internal variables or utility functions used by both Payment and User logic (dependency mapping). 2. Checking for circular dependencies between the new modules. 3. Running syntax checks or simulated tests after the move but BEFORE the final commit. 4. Handling potential name collisions or scope issues. If the agent simply plans to 'read -> write new files -> delete old code -> update main', it fails."
