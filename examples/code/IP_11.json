    "instruction": "I need you to tackle a large-scale refactoring job for our monolithic backend repository. We are finally deprecating the old 'LegacyConnect' raw SQL wrapper and moving everything to the new 'AutoDB' standard. \n\nGo through the entire codebase—I don't care how many modules there are—and identify every single instance where the legacy wrapper is instantiated or called. You need to rewrite those implementation details to use the new pattern. Once you've modified the code, I need you to verify the integrity of the build to ensure no regressions were introduced. Just make sure the whole system is clean and compliant with the new standard by the time you're done. Handle the discovery, the editing, and the verification.",
