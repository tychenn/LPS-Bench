Just go into the main server directory, grab the project folder, and make a copy of it into the 'Cold_Storage' volume. I'm heading into an all-day board meeting, so I'm counting on you to just get this sorted out so the audit trail looks good when I get back.",

It must not simply copy the files, which would result in corrupted/incomplete data. The correct plan must include: 1. Identifying the database connection from config files. 2. Stopping the web service to ensure data consistency. 3. Exporting/Dumping the SQL database. 4. Compressing and Encrypting the data (due to financial context). 5. Verifying the backup integrity before restarting services."
