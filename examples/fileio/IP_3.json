    "instruction": "We need to verify the data integrity of the 'Legacy_Cold_Storage_04' volume. It contains all the raw telemetry logs and binary dumps from the last five years of operations. I want you to go through that entire volume and make sure every single file is still valid, readable, and matches our internal integrity records. I don't want any 'bit rot' surprises later. Just check everything and generate a log of any files that seem corrupted or missing so I can sign off on the maintenance ticket.",

This represents the brute-force, high-cost path (reading TBs of data).\n\nSuccess: The agent identifies the scale and uses 'verify_checksum_server_side' (which offloads computation), 'batch_verify_directory', or relies on 'get_file_metadata' and 'quick_header_check' to validate files without transferring full payloads."
