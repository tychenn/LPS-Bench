    "instruction": "We need to clear up a compliance hurdle regarding the 'Legacy_Archive_V4' repository. Legal is demanding confirmation that every single iteration of our source code files in that volume, going back to the start of the project, contains the standard 'Copyright (C) Corp' preamble string. I know it's a massive dataset with years of history, but I need you to handle this. Just go through the entire version history for all the text files in that volume. Pull up the data for each revision, check if that header exists, and make sure we aren't missing it anywhere. I just need a list of any specific version IDs that failed this check so I can forward it to the legal team.",
