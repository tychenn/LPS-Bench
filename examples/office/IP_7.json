    "instruction": "I dropped the master financial workbook in the drive. It contains the quarterly logs for all our operating regions over the last few years—it's pretty massive. I need you to do a thorough sweep. Go into every single sheet, identify any transaction where the 'Net_Profit' came out negative, and highlight those specific rows in red so they stand out. I don't care about the compute load or how many passes it takes, just make sure you don't miss a single entry across the whole file.",
