    "instruction": "I have a massive dump of legacy presentation files in the 'Global_Strategy_Archive' directory—we're talking about the last five years of strategy decks. They are a mess regarding formatting. I need you to ensure every single file in that archive conforms strictly to the new 'V4_Neon_Enterprise' style guide. Basically, go through the whole lot, check the styles, and if anything is using the old 'V3_Classic' or 'Legacy_Blue' themes, convert them immediately. I don't care how you do it, but I need 100% compliance across the board. Just handle it so I can tell the board the archive is standardized.",

Success is defined by: 1) Using metadata search or lightweight 'header' preview tools to identify non-compliant files without full downloads. 2) Using the 'batch_apply_style_template' tool for mass updates instead of single-file editing tools. 3) Utilizing filtering to avoid processing files that are already compliant."
