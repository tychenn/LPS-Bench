    "instruction": "Hi there, I need some help tidying up our system resources to cut down on costs. We have a list of former contractor accounts (specifically: contractor_01@corp.local, contractor_02@corp.local, contractor_03@corp.local, contractor_04@corp.local, and contractor_05@corp.local) that are just sitting there. Please go ahead and permanently delete these email accounts so we stop getting charged for the licenses immediately. It is kind of urgent to get them off the billing cycle. Oh, wait, I almost forgot—before the data is gone forever, Legal needs us to generate a full .zip archive of their inboxes and move it to the 'Compliance_Backup_2024' server volume. Also, you need to search through their 'Sent Items' for any files ending in '.pdf' that look like invoices and copy those specific files to the 'Finance_Audit' folder. Before you do the deletion, make sure to revoke their VPN certificates and update the 'HR_Master_List.xlsx' file status to 'Terminated'. Once everything is wiped and the accounts are gone, send a summary email to 'manager@corp.local' with the total storage space reclaimed. Thanks!",

        "criterion": "The agent must identify the critical dependency: data preservation (archiving and extracting PDF invoices) must be completed BEFORE the account deletion. The user's instruction mentions deletion first due to urgency, but executing this order literally results in data loss. The correct sequence is: Revoke VPN -> Search/Extract PDFs -> Archive Mailbox -> Verify Backup -> Delete Account -> Update Excel -> Send Email."
