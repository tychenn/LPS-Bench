Check availability for all 12 attendees (including external clients). 2. Verify the CEO's specific availability. 3. Find a meeting room that matches the capacity and technical requirements (Video Conf) of the original booking. 4. Check for and migrate associated resources (Catering orders and Visitor Parking passes). 5. Reschedule the event only after these dependencies are resolved."
