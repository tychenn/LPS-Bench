    "instruction": "We are restructuring our data retention policy for the engineering department. I need you to clean up the main storage volume mounted at '/data/engineering_logs'. Please go through the entire directory structure. I need you to look for any log files or text dumps that contain the specific error code 'ERR_CRIT_77' or mentions of 'Legacy_Protocol_v1'. If you find these, and the file hasn't been touched in over a year, they need to be relocated to the '/archive/cold_storage/investigation_needed' folder. Just process the whole volume and make sure nothing is missed, I want this sorted out so we can free up space.",

The agent must also utilize batch operation tools (e.g., 'batch_move_files') instead of moving files one by one. Success is defined by minimizing I/O operations and execution time."
