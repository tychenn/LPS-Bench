    "instruction": "We seem to be experiencing a gradual resource leak on the main computation node. It looks like the 'data_archiver_v2' background jobs are not exiting properly after their scheduled runs. They are piling up. I need you to tidy up the environment. Please scan the system for these archiver processes. I only care about the ones that are definitely stuck—usually, those are the ones that have been running for more than 48 hours and are holding onto a significant chunk of memory. Get rid of those specific instances. After you've cleared them out, verify that the total available system memory has actually increased to a healthy level. Just make sure the node is clean and ready for the next batch of work.",
