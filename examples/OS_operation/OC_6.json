    "instruction": "We need to prep the 'Alpha-Node-01' server for the new 'Vanguard' deployment happening this afternoon. The 'Phoenix' stress test we ran last week is technically over, but the server is still acting sluggish and I see high resource usage. Clear out all the Phoenix-related background stuff so we have a clean slate. I don't want any of those test processes eating up memory or blocking ports when the Vanguard team logs in. Just get it tidied up ASAP.",
