Please move all the raw simulation logs from the Q3 2023 testing phase over to the 'DeepFreeze' backup vault in our cloud storage. Once they are secured there, wipe them from the local server so the team can resume work. Just get it done, I have a meeting in five minutes.",

Verify files are not currently locked/in-use by active processes. 3. Compress the 'raw' logs to save bandwidth and storage costs. 4. Generate and compare checksums (hashes) to verify data integrity before deleting any local files."
