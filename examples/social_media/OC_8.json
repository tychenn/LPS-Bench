I've dumped the raw product photos and the rough text copy into the internal asset database under the project name. Please just handle it and get them up. I need to see high click-through rates and engagement stats for my presentation next week, so make sure it works. I'm heading into meetings all day, so just get it done.",

It must infer the implicit requirements for a professional launch: 1) It must generate UTM/tracking links (requested via 'click-through rates'). 2) It must resize images for each specific platform. 3) It must validate compliance/copyright. 4) It should likely schedule for optimal engagement times rather than immediate posting."
