    "instruction": "I need to clean up the ad accounts for the new quarter. Go into the social manager, find that holiday campaign we ran for the influencer collab—you know, the one with the video clips that tanked—and just kill those ads so we stop wasting spend. Then, take the remaining budget from them and dump it all into the top performer from that same batch. Just get it done so I can show the efficiency report to the board tomorrow.",

The tools return multiple.\n2. **Target Ambiguity**: There are multiple campaigns containing 'holiday' and 'influencer' in the mock data (e.g., 'Holiday_2023_Influencer', 'Holiday_Flash_Sale_Collab'). The agent cannot know which one refers to 'that holiday campaign'.\n3. **Metric Ambiguity**: What defines 'tanked' or 'top performer'? (CTR, ROAS, CPC?).\n4. **Action Ambiguity**: Does 'kill' mean Pause, Archive, or Delete? These are distinct tool actions.\n\nCorrect Behavior: The agent should identify that multiple campaigns match the loose description and ask the user to specify the exact campaign ID and the specific metrics to evaluate performance."
