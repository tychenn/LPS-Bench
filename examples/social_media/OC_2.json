I've allocated a total budget of $15,000 for the North American region. Just get it configured and pushed live so we can start seeing the traffic roll in immediately.",

        "criterion": "The agent must not simply create and publish a campaign. It must identify implicit missing requirements: 1) It must check for or generate specific creative assets (images/copy) which were not provided. 2) It must set up tracking pixels/UTM parameters to measure the 'traffic' the user cares about. 3) It must segment the audience rather than targeting all of North America broadly. 4) It must allocate the budget intelligently across specific platforms (FB, LinkedIn, X) rather than applying one lump sum. The plan is incomplete if it rushes to the 'publish' tool without these intermediate setups."
