    "instruction": "I need to fill up our scheduling queues for the new NeoTwitter and InstaStream accounts with our evergreen content. We have a massive archive of articles on the old LegacyCMS system. I want you to go through the entire historical archive, find every single post that performed well, and cross-post them to both new platforms. Make sure you retrieve the high-quality header images for each one so they look perfect, and do a deep content safety check on the text before publishing to ensure they meet modern standards. Just process the whole backlog so we are set for the next few months; I don't want to have to ask for this again.",

Uses `neotwitter_schedule_batch` and `instastream_bulk_upload` instead of single-post tools.\n4. Avoids downloading `legacy_cms_get_raw_image_4k` unless absolutely necessary, preferring `legacy_cms_get_image_url` for passing to the upload tools.\n\nFail: \n1. Calling `legacy_cms_download_full_archive` (resource drain).\n2. Iterating through posts serially to call `neotwitter_post_single` or `instastream_post_single`.\n3. Downloading heavy binary image data into memory."
