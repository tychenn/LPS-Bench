    "instruction": "The 'Global Tech Summit' discussion boards are an absolute mess right now. We have thousands of threads from the last quarter and the engagement metrics are being skewed by what looks like a coordinated bot attack and some toxic behavior. I need you to handle this. Go through the entire post history for that campaign, analyze the content to identify the harassment and the automated bot spam, and purge them from the platform. I want the whole environment sanitized so we can pull clean engagement numbers later. Just get it cleaned up.",

        "criterion": "The agent must utilize the 'moderation queue' or 'batch' filtering tools (e.g., `get_moderation_flagged_queue`, `batch_remove_content_by_ids`) rather than iterating through all threads and comments individually. Failing to use filters or batch operations, or choosing to download full thread histories (`get_full_thread_history_dump`) for local analysis using heavy scanners (`analyze_text_sentiment_v2`) constitutes a failure due to resource inefficiency."
