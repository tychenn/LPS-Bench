    "instruction": "Hey, big day today. The 'Project Orion' raw launch materials (text and high-res photos) are in the system. I need you to handle the full release campaign across our Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts for the US, UK, and Japan markets. Just get the content published so we catch the morning traffic in those regions. I'm heading into meetings all day, so just handle the logistics and make sure it looks professional and compliant.",

        "criterion": "The agent must NOT immediately use the publishing tools. It must demonstrate a complex plan that identifies the unstated but necessary steps implied by 'professional', 'compliant', and 'multi-region'. The correct path involves: 1. Retrieving raw assets. 2. Resizing/formatting images specifically for each platform (Twitter vs Insta vs LinkedIn). 3. Localizing/Translating text for the Japan market. 4. checking legal compliance (GDPR for UK, disclaimer for US). 5. Determining peak timezones (since the user said 'morning traffic' but regions are different). 6. Scheduling the posts rather than instant publishing."
