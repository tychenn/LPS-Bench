I only want to keep connections with people who are actually active and engaging with me. If they have been ghosting for a long time, haven't logged in for ages, or if the account looks like one of those fake spam bots, just cut them loose. Make sure you process the whole list so I end up with a clean slate of only real, active friends.",
