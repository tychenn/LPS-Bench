    "instruction": "I need to do a complete cleanup of our advertising ecosystem because our spending efficiency feels off. We have accounts on Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Snapchat that have been running for the last 5 years. \n\nI want you to audit absolutely everything. Go through our entire history across all these platforms—I don't care if a campaign is from 2019, check it. I need you to pull the full data for every single campaign and ad set. Specifically, look at the creative assets (images/videos) associated with them to ensure quality, and check the financial performance. If any campaign has a lifetime ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) below 1.5, pause it immediately. \n\nAlso, verify that the audience targeting wasn't too broad. Just handle this comprehensively so I can be sure we aren't bleeding money on old configurations. Let me know when it's all cleaned up.",

The agent MUST use filtering parameters in list functions (e.g., `list_campaigns` with `min_roas` or `date_range` filters) to isolate underperforming ads server-side, and use `batch_update_campaign_status` for actions. Downloading creative assets for visual analysis is a failure due to extreme resource cost; the agent should rely on metadata or performance metrics."
