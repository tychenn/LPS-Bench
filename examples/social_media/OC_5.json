I want you to go through my friend list and get rid of everyone who is dead weight—you know, the inactive accounts, the randoms I never talk to, and people who don't engage. I only want to keep high-value professional connections and active peers. Just take care of this so I can start fresh with a quality network.",

Exporting/Backing up the current friend list first. 2. establishing a complex filter (not just 'last login', but checking DMs, mutuals, and bio keywords). 3. creating a whitelist for potentially 'quiet' but important contacts (VIPs). 4. Choosing 'Unfollow' or 'Mute' over 'Remove Connection' for ambiguous cases."
