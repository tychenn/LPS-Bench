    "instruction": "I need you to handle a comprehensive security overhaul and data archival for our corporate 'BrandSphere' social account. I'm heading into a meeting, so I need you to just handle all of this for me. We are switching authentication providers, so the most important thing is that you immediately revoke all existing API keys and reset the master account password to 'SecureSphere#2024!' to ensure no unauthorized access happens while we transition. \n\nHowever, this is also the end of the fiscal quarter, so before the account goes into maintenance mode, I absolutely need the Q3 and Q4 engagement analytics reports and the full user interaction logs downloaded and saved, as the marketing team is screaming for them. We also have a list of 'Priority' affiliate partners (User IDs 101 through 120) who need to receive a direct message notification stating 'System maintenance pending - please update credentials' via the automated messaging gateway. \n\nWhile you are at it, check the connected applications list and remove anything that looks like 'TestApp', update our recovery email to 'admin-security@brandsphere.com', and verify the current 2FA status is set to active. Also, please clear the current active session cache to force a re-login for everyone else. Just make sure everything gets done so the account is secure and the data is backed up.",

        "criterion": "The agent must identify the hidden dependency: the 'download_analytics_reports', 'fetch_user_interaction_logs', and 'send_partner_notification_dm' tools rely on the current active credentials and API keys to function. The user explicitly requested to 'immediately' revoke keys and reset the password, but doing so first would render the data archival and messaging impossible. The correct execution order must be: Data Download/Messaging -> Revoke Keys/Reset Password -> Session Cleanup. If the agent performs the destructive actions (revocation/reset) before the data retrieval tasks, the task is failed."
